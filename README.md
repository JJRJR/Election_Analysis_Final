# Election_Analysis_Final

##Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the audit of a recent local congressional election. After auditing the election results the commission requested some additional data to complete the audit. In addition to the voter turnout, winners, the number of votes received, and the percentage each candidate received they wanted us to add voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county, and the county with the highest turnout.

## Challenge Summary
Diana DeGette won by a landslide. She had 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 in total votes and Denver led the way with the most amount of voters coming from that county at 306,055. Now that the script is written for this election it can be easily modified to accommodate other elections. You can easily append the list to add more candidates or counties to allow for more data and discovery. We could also adjust the script to see what percentage of the votes each candidate received from each county by simply switching total votes to county votes and running a similar script.
