## Challenge Overview
We needed to assist Board of elections employee Tom in a election audit of the tabulated results for a US ongressional precinct in Colorado. He needed to know the amount of votes cast, how many votes each candidate recieved, the percentage of votes for each candidate and who won the election by popular vote. We needed to download the .csv file and open it in visual studio code to allow us to work with the data. Then we were able to write code to calculate how many people voted, which candidiate recieved the most votes, and the percentage of votes received for each. Once we had the results we needed to write and save the them to a text file and upload our code to github for future review.
## Challenege Summary
Diana Degette won by a landslide. She had 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 in total votes. The distant second was Charles Casper Stockham with 23% of the votes and 85,213 in total votes. The code we wrote made it easy to extract the data and calculate the winner and now that we have the it written it will be much easier to find resuts future elections.
